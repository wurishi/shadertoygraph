I figure this could\n// be very handy for the creation of different effects.\n//\n// Similar to how you can get the progress around the perimeter of a\n// circle by using the atan function, you can get the progress around\n// the perimeter of this DogBone by using its perimeter function. The\n// perimeter is a sum of  circle arc lengths that are normalized so as\n// to equalize stretch. NOTE: stretch is only equalized at the zero\n// distance isoline, you will get stretch when you move away from that.\n//\n// The signed distance and perimeter functions map the entire plane and\n// allow you to bend anything around the object or, when elevated to 3d,\n// would allow ray marching in bent space.\n//\n// I'd love to see perimeter functions for other primitives. It's an\n// open area and many of these functions should not be too hard to find.\n\n#define PI 3.141593\n#define TWOPI 6.283185\n#define HALFPI 1.570796\n\n// returns just the distance\nfloat sdDogBone(vec2 p, float w, float r, float b) {\n    // https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3lcGRB\n    // p = point to evaluate\n    // w = half distance between end points\n    // r = radius of endpoints\n    // b = bulge -> -1 = pinch to center 0 = straight >0 = bulge out\n    \n    if(abs(b)<1e-7) b = 1e-7;\t// prevent division by 0\n    float sb = sign(b);\n    \n    p = abs(p);\n    \n    vec2 ep = p-vec2(w, 0);\t\t\t// end point\n    float dE = length(ep)-r;\t\t// distance to end circle\n    float y = (w*w-r*r)/(2.*r*b);\t// height of center circle\n    vec2 cp = vec2(p.x, p.y-y);\t\t// position of center circle\n    vec2 ec = sb*(ep-cp);\t\t\t// vec from end point to center point\n    float rc = length(ec)-r*sb;\t\t// radius of center circle\n    float dC = sb*(rc-length(cp));\t// distance to center circle\n    \n    return ec.x*ep.y-ec.y*ep.x < 0. ? dE : dC;\n}\n\n// returns distance and perimeter\nvec2 sdpDogBone(vec2 p, float w, float r, float b) {\n    //https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3lcGRB\n    // p = point to evaluate\n    // w = half distance between end points\n    // r = radius of endpoints\n    // b = bulge -> -1 = pinch to center 0 = straight >0 = bulge out\n    // returns (perimeter angle, distance)\n    \n    w = max(w, r);\n    if(abs(b)<1e-3) b = 1e-3;\t// prevent division by 0\n    float sb = sign(b);\n    vec2 P = sign(p);\n    p = abs(p);\n    \n    vec2 ep = p-vec2(w, 0);\t\t\t// end point\n    float dE = length(ep)-r;\t\t// distance to end circle\n    float y = (w*w-r*r)/(2.*r*b);\t// height of center circle\n    vec2 cp = vec2(p.x, p.y-y);\t\t// position of center circle\n    vec2 ec = sb*(ep-cp);\t\t\t// vec from end point to center point\n    float rc = length(ec)-r*sb;\t\t// radius of center circle\n    float dC = sb*(rc-length(cp));\t// distance to center circle\n    \n    // Perimeter calculation starts here\n    \n    float beta = atan(w/y),\t\t\t// center angle \n    \t\tB = 2.*beta*rc,\t\t\t// length of middle segment\n    \t\talpha = PI*.5-beta,\t\t// end angle\n    \t\tA = sb*(PI-alpha)*r*2.,\t// length of end segments\n    \t\tlen = 2.*(B + A),\t\t// length of total perimeter\n        \ta=P.x*P.y, \t\t\t\t// perimeter angle -> flip direction per quadrant so its continuous\n        \td; \t\t\t\t\t\t// distance\n  \n    if(ec.x*ep.y-ec.y*ep.x < 0.) {  // end caps\n        a *= atan(ep.y, ep.x);\t\t// get angle, swapped coords so rollover is hidden\n        a += PI-alpha;\t\t\t\t// +PI to get positive -alpha to change starting pos\n        a /= TWOPI;\t\t\t\t\t// 0 to 1 range\n        a /= 1.-alpha/PI;\t\t\t// stretch so segment goes from 0 to 1\n        a = a*A+max(P.x, 0.)*(A+B);\t// a*A is current segment.
