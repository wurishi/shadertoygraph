This produces a more interesting and varied effect.\n\n\n\n\nRory McHenry\nI had to make some changes to get it to run. Can you review the following code and explain the changes for me?\n\n// Shadertoy example that samples the previous frame at 4 locations\n// and does something weird with them, then does advection\n\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n// initialize pattern on first frame\nif(iFrame == 0) {\n    fragColor = vec4(sin(fragCoord.x * 2.0) + cos(fragCoord.y * 2.0),\n                     sin(fragCoord.y * 2.0) + cos(fragCoord.x * 2.0),\n                     0.0, 1.0);\n    return;\n}\n\n    // Sample the previous frame at four locations\n    vec2 uv = fragCoord / iResolution.xy;\n    vec2 uv1 = (fragCoord.xy + vec2(-1, -1)) / iResolution.xy;\n    vec2 uv2 = (fragCoord.xy + vec2(1, 1)) / iResolution.xy;\n    vec2 uv3 = (fragCoord.xy + vec2(-1, 1)) / iResolution.xy;\n    vec2 uv4 = (fragCoord.xy + vec2(1, -1)) / iResolution.xy;\n    vec3 col1 = texture(iChannel0, uv1).rgb;\n    vec3 col2 = texture(iChannel0, uv2).rgb;\n    vec3 col3 = texture(iChannel0, uv3).rgb;\n    vec3 col4 = texture(iChannel0, uv4).rgb;\n    \n    // Do something weird with the samples\n    vec3 weird = (col1 + col2 + col3 + col4) * 0.25;\n    weird = (sin(weird));\n    \n    // Do advection using the \"weird\" color\n    vec2 st = fragCoord.xy/iResolution.xy;\n    uv = st - 1./iChannelResolution[0].xy * weird.xy;\n    vec3 color = texture(iChannel0, uv).rgb;\n    \n    // Output the result\n    fragColor = vec4(weird+color/2., 1.0);\n}\n\nThe changes that were made to the original code are the following:\n\nThe iMouse uniform is not used in the code, so it was removed. Instead, the code uses the fragCoord variable to determine the UV coordinates of the current fragment, and uses offsets to sample the neighboring pixels.\nThe iFrame uniform was added to the code, and used to initialize the output color on the first frame. The output color is a simple pattern of alternating blue and green stripes, generated using the sin and cos functions.\nThe uv value used for advection is no longer based on the iTime and iChannelResolution uniforms, but instead is based on the \"weird\" color value. This produces a more interesting and varied advection effect.\nThe output color is a combination of the \"weird\" color and the advected color, with the advected color being divided by 2 before being added to the \"weird\" color. This produces a more subtle effect.\nOverall, these changes make the shadertoy more flexible and versatile, and allow for more creative control over the final output.\n\n\n\n\nRory McHenry\nOkay now make some changes for me. Have some way for the components of weird to affect each other, so sometimes its x component can changes because of the y component. Make it a subtle adjustment\n\nHere is a modified version of the shadertoy that has a way for the components of the \"weird\" color to affect each other:\n\nCopy code\n// Shadertoy example that samples the previous frame at 4 locations\n// and does something weird with them, then does advection\n\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n    // initialize pattern on first frame\n    if(iFrame == 0) {\n        fragColor = vec4(sin(fragCoord.x * 2.0) + cos(fragCoord.y * 2.0),\n                         sin(fragCoord.y * 2.0) + cos(fragCoord.x * 2.0),\n                         0.0, 1.0);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Sample the previous frame at four locations\n    vec2 uv = fragCoord / iResolution.xy;\n    vec2 uv1 = (fragCoord.xy + vec2(-1, -1)) / iResolution.xy;\n    vec2 uv2 = (fragCoord.xy + vec2(1, 1)) / iResolution.xy;\n    vec2 uv3 = (fragCoord.xy + vec2(-1, 1)) / iResolution.xy;\n    vec2 uv4 = (fragCoord.xy + vec2(1, -1)) / iResolution.xy;\n    vec3 col1 = texture(iChannel0, uv1).rgb;\n    vec3 col2 = texture(iChannel0, uv2).rgb;\n    vec3 col3 = texture(iChannel0, uv3).rgb;\n    vec3 col4 = texture(iChannel0, uv4).rgb;\n    \n    // Do something weird with the samples\n    vec3 weird = (col1 + col2 + col3 + col4) * 0.25;\n    weird = (sin(weird) + cos(weird.yx)) * 0.5;\n    \n    // Do advection using the \"weird\" color\n    vec2 st = fragCoord.xy/iResolution.xy;\n    uv = st - 1./iChannelResolution[0].xy * weird.xy;\n    vec3 color = texture(iChannel0, uv).rgb;\n    \n    // Output the result\n    fragColor = vec4(weird+color/2., 1.0);\n}\nIn this version, the \"weird\" color is generated by applying the sin and cos functions to the samples, and then adding the cos of the transposed \"weird\" color. This causes the X and Y components of the \"weird\" color to affect each other, resulting in a more complex and varied color. The effect is quite subtle, since the addition is scaled down by 0.5.\n\n\n\n\nRory McHenry\nlooks like you have a type error in the weird assignment line. Id suggest using a vec3 constructor there\n\nYou are correct, there is a type error in the line that assigns the \"weird\" color. The sin and cos functions return a scalar value, but the result is being added to a vector, which is not allowed. To fix this issue, the \"weird\" color should be constructed using the vec3 constructor, like this:\n\nCopy code\n// Do something weird with the samples\nvec3 weird = (col1 + col2 + col3 + col4) * 0.25;\nweird = vec3(sin(weird) + cos(weird.yx)) * 0.5;\nThis will correctly construct a vec3 value using the results of the sin and cos functions, and the \"weird\" color will be calculated correctly.\n\n\n\n\nRory McHenry\nThe error message is '+' : wrong operand types - no operation '+' exists that takes a left-hand operand of type 'highp 3-component vector of float' and a right operand of type 'highp 2-component vector of float' (or there is no acceptable conversion)\n\nThe error message indicates that there is a type mismatch in the line that calculates the \"weird\" color. The sin and cos functions return a scalar value, but the weird.yx expression is a vec2, so the + operator cannot be used to add these values.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can use the vec3 constructor to construct a vec3 value from the sin and cos results, like this:\n\nCopy code\n// Do something weird with the samples\nvec3 weird = (col1 + col2 + col3 + col4) * 0.25;\nweird = vec3(sin(weird) + cos(weird.yx), 0) * 0.5;\nThis will correctly construct a vec3 value using the results of the sin and cos functions, and the \"weird\" color will be calculated correctly. The 0 value in the vec3 constructor is used to set the third component of the \"weird\" color to 0, so that it does not affect the advection.\n\n\n\n\nRory McHenry\nyou have to write something like vec3( a, b, c) use the full constructer with a scaler type at each element\n\nTo fix the error in the \"weird\" color calculation, you can use the vec3 constructor to construct a vec3 value from the results of the sin and cos functions, like this:\n\nCopy code\n// Do something weird with the samples\nvec3 weird = (col1 + col2 + col3 + col4) * 0.25;\nweird = vec3(sin(weird.x) + cos(weird.y), sin(weird.y) + cos(weird.x), 0) * 0.5;\nThis will correctly construct a vec3 value using the results of the sin and cos functions, and the \"weird\" color will be calculated correctly. The third component of the \"weird\" color is set to 0, so that it does not affect the advection.\n\nIn this case, the vec3 constructor is used with three scalar values, one for each component of the \"weird\" color. This allows the sin and cos functions to be applied to each component independently, resulting in a more complex and varied color.\n\n\n\n\nRory McHenry\nVery nice! now include the z component too, It wont affect the advection right away, but it will through dynamics\n\nHere is a modified version of the shadertoy that includes the Z component of the \"weird\" color in the calculation:\n\nCopy code\n// Shadertoy example that samples the previous frame at 4 locations\n// and does something weird with them, then does advection\n\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n    // initialize pattern on first frame\n    if(iFrame == 0) {\n        fragColor = vec4(sin(fragCoord.x * 2.0) + cos(fragCoord.y * 2.0),\n                         sin(fragCoord.y * 2.0) + cos(fragCoord.x * 2.0),\n                         0.0, 1.0);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Sample the previous frame at four locations\n    vec2 uv = fragCoord / iResolution.xy;\n    vec2 uv1 = (fragCoord.xy + vec2(-1, -1)) / iResolution.xy;\n    vec2 uv2 = (fragCoord.xy + vec2(1, 1)) / iResolution.xy;\n    vec2 uv3 = (fragCoord.xy + vec2(-1, 1)) / iResolution.xy;\n    vec2 uv4 = (fragCoord.xy + vec2(1, -1)) / iResolution.xy;\n    vec3 col1 = texture(iChannel0, uv1).rgb;\n    vec3 col2 = texture(iChannel0, uv2).rgb;\n    vec3 col3 = texture(iChannel0, uv3).rgb;\n    vec3 col4 = texture(iChannel0, uv4).rgb;\n    \n    // Do something weird with the samples\n    vec3 weird = (col1 + col2 + col3 + col4) * 0.25;\n    weird = vec3(sin(weird.x) + cos(weird.y),\n                 sin(weird.y) + cos(weird.x),\n                 sin(weird.z) + cos(weird.z)) * 0.5;\n    \n    // Do advection using the \"weird\" color\n    vec2 st = fragCoord.xy/iResolution.xy;\n    uv = st\n\n\n\nRory McHenry\nOkay I made some more tweaks and now it looks sick. Why don't you review again\n\n// Shadertoy example that samples the previous frame at 4 locations\n// and does something weird with them, then does advection\n\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n    // initialize pattern on first frame\n    if(iFrame == 0) {\n        fragColor = vec4(sin(fragCoord.x * 2.0) + cos(fragCoord.y * 2.0),\n                         sin(fragCoord.y * 2.0) + cos(fragCoord.x * 2.0),\n                         0.0, 1.0);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Sample the previous frame at four locations\n    vec2 uv = fragCoord / iResolution.xy;\n    vec2 uv1 = (fragCoord.xy + vec2(-1, -1)) / iResolution.xy;\n    vec2 uv2 = (fragCoord.xy + vec2(1, 1)) / iResolution.xy;\n    vec2 uv3 = (fragCoord.xy + vec2(-1, 1)) / iResolution.xy;\n    vec2 uv4 = (fragCoord.xy + vec2(1, -1)) / iResolution.xy;\n    vec3 col1 = texture(iChannel0, uv1).rgb;\n    vec3 col2 = texture(iChannel0, uv2).rgb;\n    vec3 col3 = texture(iChannel0, uv3).rgb;\n    vec3 col4 = texture(iChannel0, uv4).rgb;\n    \n    // Do something weird with the samples\n    vec3 weird = (col1 + col2 + col3 + col4) * .8;\n    weird = vec3(sin(weird.x) + cos(weird.y),\n                 sin(weird.y) + cos(weird.z),\n                 sin(weird.z) + cos(weird.x)) * 0.5;\n    \n    // Do advection using the \"weird\" color\n    vec2 st = fragCoord.xy/iResolution.xy;\n    uv = st - 1./iChannelResolution[0].xy * weird.xy;\n    vec3 color = texture(iChannel0, uv).rgb;\n    \n    // Output the result\n    fragColor = vec4(weird+color/2., 1.0);\n}\n\nIn this revised version of the shadertoy, the \"weird\" color calculation has been updated to use different trigonometric functions for each component of the \"weird\" color. The original samples are also scaled down by 0.8 before being used in the calculation.\n\nThese changes result in a more complex and varied \"weird\" color, and produce a more interesting and dynamic effect when used for advection. The advection itself remains the same as in the previous version, and the output color is a combination of the \"weird\" color and the advected color. Overall, these changes improve the visual appeal and creative potential of the shadertoy.\n\n\n\n\nRory McHenry\nCan you make a small tweak somewhere that you think would be good?\n\nOne possible tweak to the shadertoy is to use a different color space for the \"weird\" color calculation. Currently, the \"weird\" color is calculated in the RGB color space, but using a different color space can produce different and interesting effects.\n\nFor example, the \"weird\" color could be calculated in the HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) color space, like this:\n\nCopy code\n// Do something weird with the samples\nvec3 hsl = rgb2hsl(col1 + col2 + col3 + col4) * 0.8;\nhsl.x = sin(hsl.x) + cos(hsl.y);\nhsl.y = sin(hsl.y) + cos(hsl.z);\nhsl.z = sin(hsl.z) + cos(hsl.x);\nvec3 weird = hsl2rgb(hsl) * 0.5;\nIn this case, the samples are first converted to the HSL color space using the rgb2hsl function. Then, the hue, saturation, and lightness components are each transformed using a combination of the sin and cos functions. Finally, the transformed HSL color is converted back to the RGB color space using\n\n\n\n\nRory McHenry\nokay write hsl2rgb for me\n\nHere is a possible implementation of the hsl2rgb function, which converts a color from the HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) color space to the RGB (red, green, blue) color space:\n\nCopy code\nvec3 hsl2rgb(vec3 hsl)\n{\n    vec3 rgb;\n    float h = hsl.x;\n    float s = hsl.y;\n    float l = hsl.z;\n    \n    float c = (1.0 - abs(2.0 * l - 1.0)) * s;\n    float h_prime = h * 6.0;\n    float x = c * (1.0 - abs(mod(h_prime, 2.0) - 1.0));\n    float m = l - 0.5 * c;\n    \n    if (h_prime >= 0.0 && h_prime <= 1.0)\n    {\n        rgb = vec3(c, x, 0.0);\n    }\n    else if (h_prime > 1.0 && h_prime <= 2.0)\n    {\n        rgb = vec3(x, c, 0.0);\n    }\n    else if (h_prime > 2.0 && h_prime <= 3.0)\n    {\n        rgb = vec3(0.0, c, x);\n    }\n    else if (h_prime > 3.0 && h_prime <= 4.0)\n    {\n        rgb = vec3(0.0, x, c);\n    }\n    else if (h_prime > 4.0 && h_prime <= 5.0)\n    {\n        rgb = vec3(x, 0.0, c);\n    }\n    else if (h_prime > 5.0 && h_prime <= 6.0)\n    {\n        rgb = vec3(c, 0.0, x);\n    }\n    \n    return rgb + m;\n}\nThis function takes a vec3 value representing a color in the HSL color space, and returns a vec3 value representing the corresponding color in the RGB color space. It uses a series of calculations to convert the hue, saturation, and lightness values to the corresponding red, green, and blue values. This function can be used in the shadertoy to produce more interesting and varied colors in the \"weird\" color calculation.\n\n\n\n\nRory McHenry\nand now rgb2hsl\n\nHere is a possible implementation of the rgb2hsl function, which converts a color from the RGB (red, green, blue) color space to the HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) color space:\n\nCopy code\nvec3 rgb2hsl(vec3 rgb)\n{\n    vec3 hsl;\n    float r = rgb.x;\n    float g = rgb.y;\n    float b = rgb.z;\n    \n    float c_max = max(r, max(g, b));\n    float c_min = min(r, min(g, b));\n    float c = c_max - c_min;\n    \n    if (c == 0.0)\n    {\n        hsl.x = 0.0;\n    }\n    else if (c_max == r)\n    {\n        hsl.x = mod((g - b) / c, 6.0);\n    }\n    else if (c_max == g)\n    {\n        hsl.x = (b - r) / c + 2.0;\n    }\n    else if (c_max == b)\n    {\n        hsl.x = (r - g) / c + 4.0;\n    }\n    \n    hsl.y = c_max == 0.0 ? 0.0 : c / c_max;\n    hsl.z = 0.5 * (c_max + c_min);\n\n\n\nRory McHenry\nWow good job, I really like this. It changed the dynamics a lot and made the color scheme much gentler.\n\nThank you! I'm glad that the changes improved the shadertoy for you. Using a different color space for the \"weird\" color calculation can produce a more subtle and nuanced effect, which can be more aesthetically pleasing and easier to work with. Experimenting with different color spaces and transformations can help you to create unique and interesting shaders that have a distinctive visual style.\n\n\n\n\nRory McHenry\nWhat should the title and description be for this on shadertoy?\n\nHere are some possible suggestions for the title and description of this shadertoy:\n\nTitle: \"Weird Advection\"\n\nDescription: \"This shadertoy uses the previous frame as a source for sampling and creates a \"weird\" color using the samples.
