The common step size may occur several times consecutively but the rare type\n      may not repeat.\n    - The number of consecutive repetitions of the common step size may only come in two quantities which have a difference of 1.\n    - One number of consecutive repititions is the common type and the other is the rare type. Like the step sizes, the common may repeat but\n      the rare may not repeat.\n    etc.\n    \n    The more complex the ratio of the slope, the larger the cycle, the more chaotic it appears when the volume expands or retracts. The rules\n    also become more abstract the further removed it becomes from the original step size.\n\n*/\n\n\n\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n    float grid_size = 20.0;\n    \n    vec2 grid_square = vec2(\n        floor((fragCoord.x - 0.5*iResolution.x + 0.5*grid_size)/grid_size),\n        floor((fragCoord.y - 0.5*iResolution.y + 0.5*grid_size)/grid_size)\n    );\n    \n    if(dot(normalize(iMouse.xy - 0.5*iResolution.xy), grid_square) + 5.0*sin(iTime*0.5) < 0.0) {\n        fragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n    } else fragColor = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);\n    \n    if(dot(normalize(iMouse.xy - 0.5*iResolution.xy), fragCoord.xy - 0.5*iResolution.xy) + grid_size*5.0*sin(iTime*0.5) < 0.5) {\n        fragColor = 0.5*(fragColor + vec4(0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0));\n    }\n}","name":"Image","description":"","type":"image"}]}
