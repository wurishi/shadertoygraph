Sadly it's fairly expensive when using this with big amounts of blur. There is also a small issue with the brightness on certain blur sizes.\nYou're free to use this in anything you want, no need to credit me.","likes":0,"published":3,"flags":0,"usePreview":0,"tags":["postprocessing","blur"],"hasliked":0,"parentid":"","parentname":""},"renderpass":[{"inputs":[{"id":"4dfGRn","filepath":"/media/a/8de3a3924cb95bd0e95a443fff0326c869f9d4979cd1d5b6e94e2a01f5be53e9.jpg","previewfilepath":"/media/ap/8de3a3924cb95bd0e95a443fff0326c869f9d4979cd1d5b6e94e2a01f5be53e9.jpg","type":"texture","channel":0,"sampler":{"filter":"mipmap","wrap":"repeat","vflip":"true","srgb":"false","internal":"byte"},"published":1}],"outputs":[{"id":"4dfGRr","channel":0}],"code":"void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord)\n{\n    //This value modifies the size of the blur\n   \n    float blur = 10.0;\n    \n    vec3 color = vec3(0.0);\n\n    for (float i = -blur; i <= blur; i++) {\n        for (float j = -blur; j <= blur; j++) {\n            float distance = sqrt(i * i + j * j);\n            float weight = smoothstep(blur, blur - 1.0, distance);\n            color += texture(iChannel0, (fragCoord + vec2(i, j)) / iResolution.xy).rgb * weight;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    color /= (blur)*(blur+blur+blur);\n    fragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);\n}","name":"Image","description":"","type":"image"}]}
