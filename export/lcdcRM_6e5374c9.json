Droste related spiral effects are not \n    new on Shadertoy, but I really like the aesthetic, so I wanted to post one of \n    my own. I decided to produce a far less common superelliptical spiral, just to \n    show that Droste spirals need not be restricted to circles and squares. \n    \n    With spirals in general, the idea is to convert standard UV coordinates to a \n    set of concentric rings (or annulus strips) using basic transforms. Then, for \n    each angular revolution, gradually push the radial distance out by one or more \n    radial units, which forms the spiral. As a side note, the concentric rings are\n    normally circular, but they can involve any distance metric you can dream up.\n   \n    Where this differs from a regular spiral is that the radial distance increases\n    in an exponential fashion, which is accounted for by inflating the UV coordinates\n    exponentially every turn of the spiral. There is also some cyclic animation and \n    spiral shaping using a distance metric... I\"ve skipped over the details, but\n    those are contained a single function below.\n   \n    I like this particular process because it's a great example of basic complex\n    analysis operations, and if you wish to see a good example of that, have a look\n    at MLA's \"Interactive Droste Spiral\" shader. However, I didn't want any \n    extraneous transform code, so I forwent the complex math in favor of a simple \n    and intuitive function. With that said, the routine I put together is fully \n    functional... and without confusing unexplained magic numbers. :)\n    \n    By the way, most of the code is just dressing up -- I decided to transform a \n    highlighted Bauhaus style quadtree texture, for whatever reason. It's possible \n    to produce a basic frameless texture-based Droste example with very little code, \n    since the Droste transform itself is just a few lines, which can be cut down \n    even more using a few tricks here and there.\n    \n    Anyway, I have a 3D version that I'll post, once I've tweaked and commented it\n    a bit. There are some \"defines\" below, for anyone interested.\n \n    \n    \n    Other examples:\n    \n    \n    // It's a bit hard to post a Droste\\Escher related\n    // example without referencing this awesome piece of work. :)\n    Escher's prentententoonstelling - reinder \n    https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Mdf3zM\n\n    // Fabrice's simple example, which prompted me to dig up one \n    // of my own to post.
