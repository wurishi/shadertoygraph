The idea is to get the fractional part\n// of the texel coordinates and apply a smooth curve to it such that the derivatives are\n// zero at the extremes. The regular cubic or quintic smoothstep functions are just\n// perfect for this task.\n\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n    vec2 p = (fragCoord-.5)/iResolution.x;\n    vec2 uv = p*.1;\t\n\t\n    //---------------------------------------------\t\n\t// regular texture map filtering\n    //---------------------------------------------\t\n\t//vec3 colA = texture( iChannel0, uv ).xyz;\n\n    //---------------------------------------------\t\n\t// Fari filtering \n    //---------------------------------------------\t\n\tfloat textureResolution = iChannelResolution[0].x;\n\tuv = uv*textureResolution ;\n\tvec2 iuv = floor( uv );\n\tvec2 fuv = fract( uv );\n   \n    float power = iMouse.z>.5?pow(iMouse.x/iResolution.x,5.)*100.-2.:mix(-2.,10.,.5*cos(iTime*2.)+.5);\n    float uvfx = (fuv.x<=.5)?-pow(2.,power-1.)*pow(.5-fuv.x,power):pow(2.,power-1.)*pow(fuv.x-.5,power);\n    float uvfy = (fuv.y<=.5)?-pow(2.,power-1.)*pow(.5-fuv.y,power):pow(2.,power-1.)*pow(fuv.y-.5,power);\n    vec2 uvf = vec2(uvfx,uvfy);\n    uv = iuv + uvf+.5;\n    uv = (uv )/textureResolution;\n    vec3 colFari = texture(iChannel0, uv).xyz;\n\t\n    fragColor = vec4( colFari, 1.0 );\n}","name":"Image","description":"","type":"image"}]}
