// A basic temple model. No global illumination, all cheated and composed to camera:
//
// - the terrain is false perspective
// - there are two different sun directions for foreground and background. 
// - ambient occlusion is mostly painted by hand
// - bounce lighting is also painted by hand
//
// This shader was made as a continuation to a live coding session I did for the students
// of UPENN. After the initial live coded session I decided to rework it and improve it,
// and that turned out to be a bit of a pain because when looking for the final look I got
// trapped in more local minima that I usually do and it took me a while to leave them.
