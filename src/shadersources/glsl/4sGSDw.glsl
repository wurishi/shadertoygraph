/*
	By using the scalar value of a combined noise function as the
	angle to define a normalized vector field, we can produce a 
	divergence-free vector field as long as the angle varies smoothly
	which can then be used to create fluid-like motion for particles.

	The rest is scaling and offsetting the angles so that there 
	is a directional bias to the produced vector field. Allowing
	for directional motion without creating divergence (and therefore
	pockets of "stuck" particles)

	The rest is just fancy coloring to create a visually pleasing effect.
