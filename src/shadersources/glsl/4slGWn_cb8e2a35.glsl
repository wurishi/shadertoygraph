// The texture() call accepts a mip level offset as an optional parameter, which
// allows one to sample from different LODs of the texture. Besides being handy in
// some special situations, it also allows you to fake (box) blur of textures without
// having to perform a blur youtself. This has been traditionally used in demos and
// games to fake deph ot field and other similar effects in a very cheap way.
